Below is a handover-readiness checklist—a practical catalog of artefacts (files, docs, boards, and automation) that will let any incoming development team pick up LLMDB/MCP with minimal tribal knowledge.

#	Artefact	Location / Format	Purpose & Typical Contents	When to Draft
1	Product Requirements Document (PRD)	docs/product/PRD.md	User stories, non-functional goals, success metrics, out-of-scope items.	Immediately—anchors roadmap & backlog.
2	Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)	docs/adr/0001-...md (Markdown, 1-pager each)	Each irreversible design choice (LMDB vs RocksDB, Wasmtime runtime, FastAPI) captured with context, decision, consequences.	As soon as a major choice is made; continue living set.
3	High-level Architecture Diagram	docs/diagrams/llmdb_arch.drawio (PNG+source)	Boxes & arrows showing modules, data flow, trust boundaries, network ports.	Before first sprint planning.
4	Component API Reference	• docs/api/llmdb.rst (autogenerated Sphinx)  • openapi.yaml for MCP endpoints	Parameter-level docs for SDK & REST; living source of truth for backwards-compat changes.	Gen’d automatically once public surface stabilises.
5	State Machine & Protocol Spec for MCP	docs/protocol/mcp_v1.md (sequence diagrams, verb tables)	Clarifies client/server message order, error codes, heartbeat rules.	Prior to multi-team integration.
6	Database Schema Catalogue	docs/schema/index.md (DDL snippets + ERD)	Canonical definition of meta-tables (_meta/schema, _meta/code, …) and their versioning rules.	After first prototype of LLMDB core.
7	Performance Benchmark Plan & Baseline Report	benchmarks/README.md + benchmarks/results/ (csv)	Workload profiles, hardware config, target KPIs, reproducible harness scripts.	Once M0 (read-only KV) lands.
8	Threat Model & Security Checklist	docs/security/threat_model.md (STRIDE table & sequence diagrams)	Enumerates attack surfaces (WASM, LMDB mmap race), mitigations, CVE tracking workflow.	Before public beta or external audits.
9	Operational Runbooks	ops/runbooks/ (Markdown)	• Install/upgrade • Backup/restore • Disaster recovery • Performance tuning knobs.	Parallel to first staging deployment.
10	CI/CD Pipeline Config & Docs	.github/workflows/… + docs/devops/ci_cd.md	Build matrix, test stages, release tagging, PyPI publishing steps.	As soon as tests exist.
11	Code Style & Lint Guide	Already partly covered by .pre-commit, add docs/dev/style.md	Explains Ruff rules overrides, commit message convention (Conventional Commits).	Anytime; prevents PR churn.
12	Contribution Guide for Maintainers	MAINTAINERS.md	Issue triage policy, release approval checklist, security-patch procedure.	Pre-open-source or first external contribution.
13	Full Test Strategy Document	docs/quality/test_strategy.md	Test pyramid, fixture strategy, contract test targets, mutation-test threshold.	Before integration tests expand.
14	Roadmap & Backlog Board	GitHub Projects / docs/roadmap.md	Milestones, epics, quarterly OKRs; visible to all contributors.	Kick-off sprint; update continuously.
15	License & Third-Party Notice	LICENSE, NOTICE	Clear legal footing, list of embedded OSS (LMDB, Wasmtime) and their licenses.	Now—before publishing code.
16	Code of Conduct	CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md	Community standards for a healthy OSS project.	At repo open.
17	Design Mock Repo for LQL Queries	examples/lql/ (.sql files + expected output)	Realistic “golden” queries used in docs, fuzzers, and regression tests.	As LQL parser matures.
18	Docker / Dev-container Specs	docker/Dockerfile, .devcontainer/	Disposable environment matching CI, simplifies onboarding.	Early—reduces “works on my machine”.
19	Release Notes & Changelog	CHANGELOG.md using Keep-a-Changelog	Human-readable summary per version; feeds in to PyPI/GitHub releases.	Start at v0.1-alpha.
20	Sample Deployment Manifests	deploy/ (Docker-Compose, Helm chart)	One-click run on laptop, plus production-ish K8s example.	When MCP server has env vars finalised.

Optional (but valuable)
	•	UX wireframes / client SDK docs if you plan a CLI or GUI browser.
	•	SLO & Observability Charter: target latencies, alert thresholds, exemplar dashboards (Grafana JSON).
	•	Internationalisation (i18n) Plan if strings appear in server responses.
	•	Data Privacy Assessment (DPIA) if handling personal data.

Sequencing Hints
	1.	Lock in PRD, ADR-0001, and architecture diagram up front.
	2.	Draft protocol spec before multiple clients exist.
	3.	Threat model & security checklist no later than public beta.
	4.	Operational runbooks & deployment manifests before first on-prem install.
	5.	Performance benchmark harness and baseline report immediately after the storage kernel is functional, so you can track regressions.

Deliverable Summary

The repository you already sketched covers source, tests, README, AGENTS guide, LQL spec. The list above fills the remaining gaps: product context, design rationale, security, operations, CI/CD, and governance.
Creating even lightweight versions of these artefacts will give incoming engineers, DevOps, and security reviewers everything they need to understand, extend, operate, and ship LLMDB with confidence.
